//Switch statement
You can only switch on an expression of a type that can be statically evaluated,
which restricts it to the built-in integral types, bool, and enum types (and nullable
versions of these), and string type.

//boxing and unboxing 
boxing is the act of coverting a value type instance to a reference type instance i.e object type or interface type 
unboxing is the act of casting the object type to value type . Unboxing requires expliciit and exact casting i.e the follwoing will trhow error 
object obj =9;
long lng= (long)obj;
rather it should be written like this long lng= (long)(int)obj; so the unboxing here is done by the (int) castint i.e the exact type casting 

//Delegate Vs Interface
What can be acheived by delegate can also be done by interface, So when to choose delegate over interface(if one or more of below is met)
>when the interface has only one method
>When multicast capability is needed
>the subscriber need to implement the interface multiple times

//Equality of delegate instances 
>two delegate are said to be equal if they have the same method targets
>tow mulitacast delegate instances are equal if they have they have the same method targets and in the same order
